IEEE 754 standard specifies interchange and arithmetic formats and methods for binary and decimal floating-point arithmetic in computer programming environments. An implementation of a floating-point system conforming to this
standard may be realized entirely in software, entirely in hardware, or in anycombination of software and hardware. The goal of this project is to develop a application capable of doing the floating point arithmetic in Haskell
using Lists.
